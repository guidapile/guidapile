### 4 Bedroom House for Sale in Potchefstroom Central

Exclusive Mandate.

Situated centrally, this property brings loads of opportunity whether you are looking to stay or rent out. The main house has four bedrooms and two bathrooms and allows for one of the rooms to be rented out or occupied by a family member by simply closing the door because it has a kitchenette and an en-suite bathroom. The house also has a living area and a dining room that has a fireplace for when itâ€™s cold. The kitchen is the heart of this well-designed home. A room right next to the kitchen can be used as a scullery or laundry room with enough cupboards.

The front yard has a double carport which can be used as a parking area for the flatlet on the right side of the house, which also has a kitchenette and an en-suite bathroom. At the back of the house, the covered area can be used as either an entertainment area or as parking bays for the main house. There is also a wendy house and an extra storage room in the backyard.
